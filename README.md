===================

This is a prototype of a matrix widget for OpenERP 6.0.x web client.

This project is sponsored by [Smile](https://www.smile.fr).


Features
--------

  * Per-column and per-cell editability and visibility
  * Two types of cell widgets: float input fields and float increment buttons
  * Hierarchical grouping of lines within the matrix body
  * Lines can be added and deleted in edit mode
  * Dynamic per-column and per-line sums in edit mode
  * Date-based columns

You should also [browse the bug tracker](https://github.com/kdeldycke/smile_openerp_matrix_widget/issues): it's the best place to get an idea of which features are missing or are not implemented yet.

FAQ
---

**Why is this module not in [Smile's canonical repository for OpenERP contibutions](https://code.launchpad.net/smile-openerp) ?**

This code started its life in Smile's internal Subversion repository and was [migrated to Git](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2011/08/how-open-source-an-internal-corporate-project-webping/) to not loose its commit history, which would have been the case if the project was to be pushed to Bazaar.
